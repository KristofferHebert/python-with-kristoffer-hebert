# String manipulation in Python
Learn about string.replace, len, and print in this chapter.

## Overview
String.replace(target, new_value) takes two arguments. First argument is the target or part of the string you want to replace. Second argument is the new value you want to replace the target with.

Len(variable) tells you the length of variable passed to it. It only takes one argument.

Print(variable) allows someone to write the value of a variable out to the console. This is useful in debugging.

## Summary
- Output variables to the console via "Print"
- Get length of variable via len(variable_name)
- Replace part of string with variable_name.replace(keyword, new_value)
- Decrement number with --number 
- Increment number with ++number
- Strings can be combined with string_name += variable

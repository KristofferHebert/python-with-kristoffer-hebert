# String manipulation in Python
Learn about string.replace, len, and print in this chapter.

## Overview
String.replace takes two arguments. First argument is the target or part of the string you want to replace. Second argument is the new value you want to replace the target with.

Len tells you the length of variable passed to it. It only takes one argument.

Print allows someone to write the value of a variable out to the console. This is useful in debugging.

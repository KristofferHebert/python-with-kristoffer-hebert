# Loops in Python
Learn about the different types of Python loops. The examples of loops covered are: "For, and "While"

## Overview
The syntax of Python "for" loop is "for item of items:". You can use this to loop over every item inside a list. 

The syntax of Python "while" loop is "while(boolean statement):". An example of a boolean statment would be "variable < 25". If the value of "variable" is 5, this statement will return true and the loop will continue. You can increment "variable" like this: "variable +=1". What this does is add 1 to the value of "variable". Eventually "variable" will be greater than 25 and return false. This will break the while loop.

You can treat "while" statements like an "if" statment and use an "else:" case. "Else" is executed when the "if" clause is false.

You can also break loops with "break" keyword.

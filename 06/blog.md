# Data Structures in Python
Python has four ways to structure data in list like objects. They are: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets.

## Overview
Python list syntax is "variable = [1,2,3]". List functions like an array, with indexes. Index starts at 0. For example "print variable[0]" would print the value of "1".

Python tuples syntax is "variable = (1,2,3)". Tuples functions similary to lists. What makes it unique is that it is immutable. This allows for more memory efficient creation of lists. 

Python dictionary syntax is "variable = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}". This is similar to objects in other C type languages. You can get the value of the index by using it's key. 
For example: "print variable['a']" would return "1".

Python set syntax is "set(['one','two', 'three'])". What makes "sets" unique as a data structure is that they filter out duplicates.

## Summary
- Python list syntax is "variable = [1,2,3]"
- Python tuples syntax is "variable = (1,2,3)"
- tuples are immutable
- Python dictionary syntax is "variable = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}"
- Python set syntax is "set(['one','two', 'three'])"
- set have no duplicate values.
